The following is my submission for the Astronomical Data Processing teaching unit.

## Data
The data has not been made available as I am not sure of under which license it was distributed. The following work is for education purposes.

## User Guide

The data should be inside a folder called `data`, next to the jupyter notebook. The notebooks look for for files in the following path : `./data/8_Oct/*` and `./data/9_Oct/*`. Please make sure the data is in the right structure before running the notebooks.

## Notebooks

Notebooks are alaready pre-computed.
